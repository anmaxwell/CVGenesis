# CV Recorder

This is an app to be able to record CVs coming in for roles and track progress.

## Why I built this

We don't have a single, easy to use tool for seeing what CVs have come in for which roles, reporting, how long they have been in which state or how they progress through the process.  The aim of this app is to identify any blockages within the process that can be improved, give an easy to read update of what has happened within any specific role, see what active CVs we have and have the potential to pass CVs between roles.
